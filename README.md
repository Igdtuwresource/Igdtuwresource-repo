Igdtuw Resource
Hey, I have made a full stack website for my university; Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women : "IGDTUW RESOURCE"
where students can access all the notes, books, previous year papers, practical work, syllabus , tutorial sheets and much more special notes.

I have made it using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node JS, React JS, Firebase.
